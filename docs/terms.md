## Tax Advice

MAGIC Grants makes no representation as to whether all or any portion of your donations to us are tax deductible or eligible for tax credits. MAGIC Grants will have no liability for any claim by any federal, state, local or any other tax authority with respect to the characterization on any applicable tax return of any donation by you. You should consult your tax advisor as to the amount of your donation that is tax deductible or eligible for tax recognition, if any.

Please [contact](mailto:info@magicgrants.org) MAGIC Grants if you need assistance with Form 8283 (for non-cash donations).

If you donate anonymously and do not provide MAGIC Grants with the information necessary for us to provide a donation receipt with the required attributes, or if you do not request for MAGIC Grants to sign Form 8283 when required (for non-cash donations), then your donation may not be tax deductible.

## No Exchange Services

MAGIC Grants is not a digital currency exchange, money services business, or wallet service and does not receive, hold, or exchange digital currencies on behalf of any other person or entity. MAGIC Grants collects donations on this website for its own purposes.

## Points and Perks

For certain eligible donations, MAGIC Grants may allow donors to optionally receive points for their donation. These points can be redeemed for a variety of merchandise and other products and services.

In general, you can earn 1 point per $1 donated, and you can redeem 10 points for $1 worth of perks. MAGIC Grants can change the earning and redemption values at any time without notice. MAGIC Grants may run promotions that change these values. The values may differ for different campaigns and for different perks. Always check the actual number of points that you will earn when donating and the actual points cost for perks, since MAGIC Grants makes no representation that points are always earned and redeemed at the same rate.

When you choose to receive points for your donation, you reduce the amount of your donation that contributes to the applicable campaign and/or fund. This may also reduce the amount of your donation that qualifies for a deduction, since you receive goods and/or services for your donation. You may decide to not receive points for your donation. Your donation receipt will indicate if you received perks or not and the approximate value of those perks.

Your decision to receive or not to receive points for your donation is final. MAGIC Grants cannot adjust your donation to include or exclude points after you have selected an option.

Taxes, fees, and shipping costs may apply when attempting to redeem points for perks, and this may increase the number of points that it takes to purchase a perk. If you are charged import taxes/duties when receiving an item, it is your obligation to separately pay these duties. Please contact the relevant third-party merchant if you are charged import duties; they might reimburse the costs that you need to pay. In no cases whatsoever will MAGIC Grants reimburse these expenses.

Points can be redeemed for a variety of perks, which may include merchandise, goods, and/or services. MAGIC Grants makes no guarantees whatsoever that points can be redeemed for any particular product or service. Products and services are subject to availability. MAGIC Grants does not issue refunds or exchanges for perk products or services. You may be able to work out a return with the third-party merchant in accordance with their policies. MAGIC Grants makes no representations on the products and services offered. You are responsible for verifying the full details, specifications, terms and conditions, and privacy policy of the merchant that you purchase from. There may be no products or services available at a given time.

If you have an issue with the product or service that you received, please first contact the merchant for assistance. MAGIC Grants will work with you and the merchant to resolve the issue.

You are responsible for providing the correct shipping and delivery details for your perk redemptions. MAGIC Grants shares your provided details with the applicable merchant that fulfills your order. This is necessary for your order to be processed.

MAGIC Grants may discontinue the points and perks program without notice. If terminated, MAGIC Grants will treat any remaining points as a donation to MAGIC Grants. The value of points are not guaranteed. Points are not redeemable for cash. Points cannot be transferred to another person or account. If the program is terminated, please [contact](mailto:info@magicgrants.org) MAGIC Grants for a donation receipt for your points.

If your account is terminated/closed for violation of these Terms of Use, then any points in the account will be forfeited without any compensation or donation receipt.

## Membership

This Site includes certain opportunities to earn a "Membership" for donating to specific campaigns. This Membership may include certain perks, which may be added, modified, or removed at any time without notice.
