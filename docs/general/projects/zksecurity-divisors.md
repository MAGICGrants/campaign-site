MAGIC Grants is interested in commissioning [zkSecurity](https://www.zksecurity.xyz/) to provide a third review of Monero's intended use of an eliptic curve divisors technique [posited by Eagen](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/596).

Veridise and Cypher Stack have already supported the technique through different approaches.

zkSecurity is highly qualified for this project.

Due to the importance of this component, a third review is heavily preferred by the Monero research community. These views were expressed in a Monero Research Lab meeting on February 4, 2026.

The goal of this engagement is to conclusively confirm the soundness of the approach. If soundness for the protocol as stated cannot be proved (in their view), then the goal is to augment the protocol and then rigorously prove soundness of the augmented version.
