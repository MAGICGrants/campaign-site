MAGIC Grants is fundraising for a review of the Substrate components of the forthcoming Serai network. This includes critical components related to Serai's protocol, runtime, economics specification, custom pallets, and more.

[SRLabs](https://srlabs.de/) has deep experience with Substrate code, and they are the security firm that MAGIC Grants anticipates will be selected for this project.
