MAGIC Grants has commissioned Veridise to conduct an audit of the Monero FCMP++ gadgets and circuit. This security audit is necessary to ensure that the gadgets, circuits, and implementation are secure.

This audit is expected to be completed in May 2025. The final report will either prove that the implemented membership proof is a proof for the intended statement or detail the issues faced and any proposed remediations.
